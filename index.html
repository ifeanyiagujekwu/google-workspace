                        Absolutely. In fact, you can share the same link with all meeting
                        participants, making it easier to get everyone you need on the call.
                        
                        <h2>Is a third-party service required for dial-in access?</h2>
                        No. With Google Workspace, you have the ability to include a phone
                        number and PIN on each of
                        your meetings with no other configuration required. Check the dial-in

                        ask for any plugins or software to be installed, Meet works entirely in the browser. This limits the
                        attack surface for Meet and the need to push out frequent security patches on end-user machines. On mobile,
                        we recommend that you install the Meet or Gmail app from Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.
